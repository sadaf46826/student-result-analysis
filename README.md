Student Result Analysis
Description
This project analyzes student performance data to derive meaningful insights. Using Python's data analysis and visualization libraries, the notebook processes and explores a dataset to identify trends, correlations, and patterns in student results.

Features
Data Exploration: Includes statistical summaries and structural information about the dataset.
Visualization: Generates plots to illustrate relationships and distributions within the data.
Data Processing: Cleans and prepares the dataset for analysis.
Technologies Used
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Seaborn: For generating detailed and visually appealing statistical graphics.
Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Dataset
The analysis is based on the student.csv dataset, which should be placed in the same directory as the notebook.
